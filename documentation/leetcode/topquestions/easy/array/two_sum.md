# Two Sum

[LeetCode Question Link](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/top-interview-questions-easy/92/array/546/)

[Solution](https://github.com/apvasanth03/CodingProblem/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/vasanth/codingproblem/leetcode/topquestions/easy/array/TwoSum.kt)

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```
