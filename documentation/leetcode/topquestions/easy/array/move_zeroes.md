[Solution](https://github.com/apvasanth03/CodingProblem/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/vasanth/codingproblem/leetcode/topquestions/easy/array/MoveZeroes.kt)

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Example:**

```
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Note:**

* You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
* Minimize the total number of operations.
