# Symmetric Tree

[LeetCode Question Link](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/top-interview-questions-easy/94/trees/627/)

[Solution](https://github.com/apvasanth03/CodingProblem/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/vasanth/codingproblem/leetcode/topquestions/easy/tree/SymmetricTree.kt)

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```

**Follow up:** Solve it both recursively and iteratively.
